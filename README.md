# Golang Server test
### This is the test server in golang with file database
  Here I have added a server written in Golang which use file as database. It uses file in dynamic and static database, You can see it by name. In Dynamic database, it fetch data from file on every request on the other hand in static it fetch data from file only at once in main function and then show that data in different manner. Just for testing.
